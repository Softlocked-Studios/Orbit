# Orbit Programming Language
Orbit is a multi-paradigm programming language that is interpreted and built on top of Java, designed for simplicity, versatility and performance. It offers a unique blend of features from imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from scripting to large-scale software development.

Orbit has a unique approach to it's syntax, offering a diverse range of options to accommodate different programming styles and preferences. For example, Orbit draws inspiration from languages like C, Lua, JavaScript, and Python. Whether you would like a traditional C-like syntax with braces and semicolons or embracing more expressive alternatives such as the usage of keywords like "then" and "end", Orbit has them both, and much more.

## Features
- Multi-Paradigm: Orbit supports imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the style that best suits their needs.
- Diverse Syntax: As already stated, developers have the freedom to write code in a manner that best suits their individual preferences.
- Dynamic Typing: Variables in Orbit are dynamically typed, allowing for flexibility and ease of use.
- Garbage Collection: Due to being built on Java, Orbit also employs automatic memory management through garbage collection.
- Extensible: Orbit additionally allows developers to directly load java libraries into it's programs.

## The Orbit Package Manager
Although, as of speaking, it is highly experimental, Orbit also features it's own package manager and module system.

Currently, this serves no real use, due to the fact that there aren't any repositories or many libraries in the first place, but we hope to further develop it.
